1. About this planet

117 years ago a human colonization ship was on its way to colonize a newly discovered habitable planet.
Due to technical failures on the colonization ship it emerged out of hyperspace near an unknown far-away star system.
It had no energy left to make it to any known system.
Luckily analysis showed that the nearby star system had a habitable planet so the colonists went for it.
Once the ship got near the planet, however, multiple technical systems of the ship started failing.
The captain chose to make an emergency landing on the planet.
Trapped on the planet the humans established a settlement, hoping that one day they would be discovered.

2. About Exorions

The human colonists discovered that the planet was inhabited by hostile and aggressive animals.
These are now known as Exorions.
In addition to this they seemed to have been genetically enhanced, making them lethal.
Due to the Exorions the human colonists could not spread much further from their initial settlement and, as their supplies ran out, were forced to confine themselves there.
They errected tall and massive walls to prevent the creatures from invading the city in masses and bided their time.

3. About Suriver City

The first settlement the human colonists established is now Suriver City.
It lies on Suriver, one of the large rivers on the continent.
It has multiple apartment buildings, the town hall, a large shopping tower and the headquarters of Crystalis Corporation.

4. About Controllers

A few years ago an archeological expedition discovered ruins near Suriver City.
These seem to have stemmed from a previous civilization.
They contained advanced mind-controlling technology, designed to control the Exorions.
With this the Exorions could be tamed and were no longer a threat.
This technology was reverse-engineered and serial production of it began.
Humans who learned how to bring Exorions under their control and use them for their purposes came to be known as Controllers.
Some members of the expedition founded the Crystalis Corporation.
It is the main producer and supplier of Controller technology.

- When trying to leave the room the following happens:
Window appears: You got a new HoloWatch Message.
Main quest starts
HoloWatch message is received

- The Player leaves the room through a warp tile
- Outside is Suriver City
- Main junctions of the city contain "HoloWatch Information Panels"
- Fat guy stands next to one panel and says:
"Technology is incredible! These panels upload data directly to your wrist. Try it! Hold your HoloWatch next to them and you will see where you are! Oh wait, I am in the wrong game."
- The character can scan them with the HoloWatch and a holobox pops up, showing directions
- If the player tries to leave the city without becoming a Controller, the guards will stop him.
